## About me

I’m a PostDoc researcher in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Alberta, working under the supervision of [Dr. Alona Fyshe](http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~alona/) and [Dr. Carrie Demmans Epp](http://www.cdemmansepp.com/). Prior to this, I was a Research Scientist at [Symanto Research](https://www.symanto.com/).
<br>

I received my PhD in Computer Science from the Technical University of Valencia - Spain. I worked in my PhD on the detection of false online content, e.g. fake news, clickbaits. Also, I worked on profiling online users that spread false content. My PhD thesis is available [here](https://riunet.upv.es/bitstream/handle/10251/158570/Ghanem%20-%20On%20the%20detection%20of%20false%20information%3A%20from%20rumors%20to%20fake%20news.pdf?sequence=4). 

Prior to this, my master’s thesis completed at the Arab American University - Palestine, where I developed an Arabic plagiarism detection system for research articles. In general, my research interests focus on developing machine learning models for various NLP tasks, with a particular focus on figurative languages detection (irony, satire, etc.) and hate speech (e.g. misogynistic content).


Outside work, I enjoy running and playing beach/indoor volleyball whenever I get a chance.

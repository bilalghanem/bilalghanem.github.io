## About me

I’m a Sr Principal, Quantitative Analytics and Data Science in the [TalentNeuron](https://www.gartner.com/en/human-resources/research/talentneuron) Team, Gartner. Currently, I am working on applying state-of-the-art NLP techniques to analyze and provide insights on the world's job posts.

<!-- I’m a PostDoc researcher in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Alberta, working under the supervision of [Dr. Alona Fyshe](http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~alona/) and [Dr. Carrie Demmans Epp](http://www.cdemmansepp.com/). Currently, I am working on question generation for educational purposes, where I am studying the generation of questions that can assess specific reading comprehension skills. -->

I received my PhD in Computer Science from the Technical University of Valencia - Spain. During my PhD I worked on the detection of "Information Disorder", with a particular focus on figurative language detection (irony, satire, etc.), hate speech (e.g. misogynistic content), and fake news (e.g. propaganda). Also, I worked on profiling online users that spread false content. My PhD thesis is available [here](https://riunet.upv.es/bitstream/handle/10251/158570/Ghanem%20-%20On%20the%20detection%20of%20false%20information%3A%20from%20rumors%20to%20fake%20news.pdf?sequence=4). 
<!-- In the last few months of my PhD, I started working as a Research Scientist at [Symanto Research](https://www.symanto.com/). -->

Prior to this, I completed my master’s thesis at the Arab American University - Palestine, where I developed an Arabic plagiarism detection system for research articles. In general, my research interests focus on developing machine learning models for various NLP tasks, or any problem that can be solved with ML-based techniques.


Outside work, I enjoy running (inspired by [Simone Paolo Ponzetto](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/dws/people/professors/prof-dr-simone-paolo-ponzetto/)) and playing beach/indoor volleyball whenever I get a chance.
